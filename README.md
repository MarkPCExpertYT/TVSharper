TVSharper is a modification of the original TVSharp with some extra features such as: 
 - Direct sampling support (toggle-able)
 - Support for frequencies below 10 MHz
 - The video window is now a normal window visible in the taskbar
 - There are now seperate 3.0 MSPS PAL and NTSC modes (experimental)

Removed features: 
 - Built-in gain control (replaced with direct sampling option)

To-do:
 - [ ] Better layout
 - [ ] Fix bug where the screen constantly moves horizontally when on 2.5MSPS PAL SECAM mode


## Credits: 

 - Youssef Touil and Ian Gilmour for the original code
 - Me for the extra features

### If the original authors want this taken down, I will do so.
