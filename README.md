# TVSharper
### An analog TV decoder for the RTL-SDR (but sharper).
help me find a new name.
##
TVSharper is a modification of the original TVSharp with some extra features such as: 
 - Direct sampling support (toggle-able)
 - Support for frequencies below 10 MHz
 - The video window is now a normal window visible in the taskbar

Removed features: 
 - Built-in program gain control (replaced with direct sampling option)

To-do:
 - [ ] Better layout
 - [ ] Fix bug where the screen constantly moves horizontally when on 2.5MSPS PAL SECAM mode
 - [ ] Fix bug where the program sometimes randomly throws an ArgumentException "The frequency cannot be set"
 - [ ] Seperate 3.0 MSPS PAL and NTSC modes

### If the original authors want this taken down, I will do so.
